# Projects from my life
I have a list from my college detailing all the assignments that students need to complete by the end of their second year. I want to make all of them

I will also add the apps for resolving mathematical tasks that we have ever received


## Navigation
All folders named after the app contain `.cpp`, `.py`, `.exe`, `.js` files or another executable file for running the application, as well as a separate folder for the code
